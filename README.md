MapPress
========

WordPress + MapBox = MapPress

Instructions
------------

Currently you have to add the MapPress code to your theme structure. Soon it will be a full featured parent theme.

Add this repository to your theme folder, example:
```
wp-content/themes/your-theme/mappress
```

Include this line in your functions.php file
```php
include(TEMPLATEPATH . '/mappress/mappress.php');
```
